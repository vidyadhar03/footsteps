# Footsteps Landing Page

**Footsteps** is a travel storytelling platform where journeys become stories — and those stories shape your travel identity.

This repository contains the public **landing page** for the Footsteps mobile app. Built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and integrated with **Supabase**, it captures early access sign-ups and support messages from users. It’s minimal, fast, and designed to evolve with the product.
