    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data for money.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="public-content">5) Public Content &amp; Search</h2>
    <p>If you post a public story or maintain a public profile, your content and associated location tags may be viewable by anyone and may be indexed by search engines. Even if you later delete content, cached or archived copies may persist for a period outside our direct control.</p>

    <h2 id="retention">6) Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes stated in this policy.</li>

    <h2 id="breach">9) Data Breach Notification</h2>
    <p>If a data breach materially affects your personal data, we will notify you without undue delay—<strong>within 72 hours</strong> where required by law (for example, under GDPR), or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2 id="children">10) Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <h2 id="xborder">11) International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed and stored outside your state or country (for example, on cloud infrastructure). Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) to protect your data during cross‑border transfers.</p>

    <h2 id="automated">12) Automated Processing &amp; Moderation</h2>
    <p>We may use automated systems to recommend content, rank feeds, detect spam or abuse, and enhance safety. Significant decisions that materially affect your rights will include human review where required by law.</p>

    <h2 id="deletion-process">13) Account &amp; Data Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
